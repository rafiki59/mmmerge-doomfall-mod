# Doomfall – Gameplay Overhaul for Might and Magic Merge (MMMerge)

Welcome to the official repository for **Doomfall**, a major gameplay overhaul for **Might and Magic Merge (MMMerge)**.

This repository documents Doomfall’s core systems, mechanics, and design philosophy. It is intended for both new players discovering the mod and experienced veterans looking to push the MMMerge engine to its limits.

---

## What is Doomfall?

**Doomfall** is a deep gameplay overhaul for **Might and Magic Merge**, designed to push the game engine far beyond its original limits while remaining fully accessible to beginners thanks to complete difficulty modularity.

Unlike simple stat tweaks, Doomfall reworks how challenge is generated at runtime in MMMerge. Every aspect of gameplay difficulty can be adjusted, from very casual play to extreme endgame chaos, while remaining stable, map-faithful, and compatible with long playthroughs.

Doomfall is the second chapter of the **Heroes of the Nexus** project and natively includes the **Extra Class Pack Mod**.

## The Three Doomfall Settings

Doomfall separates difficulty into **three independent systems**, each adjustable on its own.

### Difficulty

The Difficulty setting controls the overall combat challenge in **Might and Magic Merge**.

It affects enemy damage, health, speed, and overall combat pressure.

- **Piece of Cake / Very Easy / Easy** — ideal for beginners and relaxed play
- Higher difficulty levels progressively increase challenge and are designed for experienced players

Difficulty can be adjusted without changing monster density or boss presence.

---

### Density

Density controls how many monsters populate the world, without changing their individual strength.

- Vanilla density preserves the original MMMerge experience
- Higher density enables large-scale battles with hundreds — or even up to **1000 active monsters**

This setting is ideal for players who want more action without stronger enemies.

---

### Boss

The Boss setting controls the presence of **additional unique bosses**.

- Bosses are generated from existing monster populations
- They receive special skills and elite combinations
- Normal enemies are never replaced

You can keep difficulty and density fully vanilla and enable bosses only.

---

## Beginner Friendly by Design

Despite its extreme potential, Doomfall is fully playable for **new and casual players**.

Low difficulty presets allow players to explore Doomfall systems at their own pace. Every mechanic can be enabled, reduced, or pushed further depending on preference.

---

## Extreme Monster Density

Doomfall allows monster density far beyond vanilla limits, reaching up to **1000 active monsters on a single map**.

The system respects MMMerge engine constraints through:
- Intelligent pseudo-spawning
- Preservation of original monster distribution
- Exclusion of unstable entities such as town NPCs or guards

---

## Dynamic Boss System

Doomfall introduces **more than 50 unique additional bosses**, dynamically generated from the map’s existing monsters.

Bosses:
- Are selected from real map populations
- Avoid minority monster types for balance
- Spawn safely after map load

### Boss Skills and Elite Variants

Bosses can receive powerful abilities such as:

Adamantite, Berserker, Blinker, Voodoo, Diamondskin, Immolator, Horror, Lifedrinker, Mana Vampire, Petrifier, Plagueborn, Summoner, Terror, Void Stalker, Venomous, Wrath Animator, and many more.

Some bosses may become **Elite**, gaining multiple synergistic abilities and enhanced durability.

---

## Engine-Safe Design

Doomfall prioritizes stability even at extreme settings:

- Safe delayed spawning
- Hard locks to prevent duplicate bosses
- Full New Game reset handling
- Dynamic name allocation
- Multiplayer-safe behavior

All systems are designed to remain playable and recoverable.

---

## Who Is Doomfall For?

- Beginners looking for a customizable MMMerge experience
- Players who want smooth difficulty progression
- Veterans seeking brutal endgame challenge
- Experimenters who enjoy pushing game systems to their limits
- Multiplayer groups looking for scalable chaos

---

## Who Is Doomfall Not For?

- Players seeking a strictly vanilla Might and Magic Merge experience
- Players looking for a single fixed ultra-hardcore preset

---

## FAQ

**Can I push all three settings to the maximum?**  
Yes, but be warned: combining maximum difficulty, density, and bosses can result in an extremely intense and potentially overwhelming experience.

**Is Doomfall compatible with multiplayer?**  
Yes. Doomfall is designed with multiplayer compatibility in mind. Future updates will address any remaining edge cases.

**Why are new classes included?**  
The Extra Class Pack Mod is an independent module that integrates naturally with the base game, offering additional classes without forcing complex configuration.
